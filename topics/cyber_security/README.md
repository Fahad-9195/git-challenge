## Introduction
Cybersecurity is the protection of systems, networks, and data from digital attacks. It aims to reduce risk and ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of information.

## Examples
- Firewalls and access-control policies.
- Encryption to protect data in transit and at rest.
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to reduce account compromise.
- Vulnerability management and regular patching.
- Threat monitoring and response (SIEM/EDR) for early incident detection.

## Conclusion
Cybersecurity is a shared responsibility. We recommend continuous updates, strong passwords, and awareness of phishing and social engineering.
